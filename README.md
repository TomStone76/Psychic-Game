# Psychic-Game

This is a JavaScript guessing game. The player clicks any letter key to start, and keeps pressing keys to guess which letter the computer randomly selected. If the player does not guess correctly after nine tries, the user loses and the computer selects a new letter. If the player guesses correctly, she or he wins and a new random letter is generated.
